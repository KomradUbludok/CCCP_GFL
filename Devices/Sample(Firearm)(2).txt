The Explanation
Now we will break it down variable by variable (and split it into sections). (offsets and gibs will not be covered)

AddDevice = HDFirearm // The instance call, defines the next text as parts of a HDFirearm.

	InstanceName = Gun Template // The name used to refer to the instance later.

	AddToGroup = Weapons // The group it will be under when you start a skirmish with no pre-placed brain.  Not required*

	Mass = 3 // The mass in kg for example; 0.01 would be 10g, 0.1 would be 100g and 1 would be 1kg.

	HitsMOs = 0 // Boolean value that determines if this particle can hit by other particles.

	GetsHitByMOs = 1 // Boolean value that determines if this particle can be hit by other particles.

	SpriteFile = ContentFile
		FilePath = Base.rte/Devices/Pistols/Pistol.bmp // Tells The HDFirearm to use the sprite specified.

	FrameCount = 2 // How many frames to use, 1 or 2 for the time being, one before shooting, one during shooting.

	SpriteOffset = Vector
		X = -7
		Y = -3
	EntryWound = AEmitter
		CopyOf = Dent Metal // The emitter to use for where the bullet enters the HDF.

	ExitWound = AEmitter
		CopyOf = Dent Metal // The emitter to use for where the bullet exits the HDF.

	GoldValue = 5 // How much the HDF costs.
*HDFirearms automatically get put into the group weapons, if not put in any other groups.
AtomGroups and Deepgroups

	AtomGroup = AtomGroup // Defines the next text as parts of a AtomGroup

		AutoGenerate = 1 // Defines whether or not to generate the an AtomGroup based on the sprite (1) or not (0).*

		Material = Material // Defines the material that the round will be made up of.

			CopyOf = Military Stuff // Reference to the material you want the round to be made of.

		Resolution = 4 // Unknown.

		Depth = 0 // 

	DeepGroup = AtomGroup // Defines the next text as parts of a DeepGroup

		AutoGenerate = 1
		Material = Material
			CopyOf = Military Stuff
		Resolution = 4
		Depth = 10

	DeepCheck = 1 //
*in which case you must define the object with a set of

	JointStrength = 75 // How much force is required to be slung out of your grip.

	JointStiffness = 0.5 // How much force is required to move the joint

	JointOffset = Vector
		X = -3
		Y = 2

	DrawAfterParent = 0 // Boolean value that determines if it is drawn in front of the parent a.k.a hand (1) or not (0).

	OneHanded = 1 // Boolean value that determines if it is held with one hand (1) or two (0).

	StanceOffset = Vector
		X = 12
		Y = 0
	SharpStanceOffset = Vector
		X = 13
		Y = -2
	SupportOffset = Vector
		X = -1
		Y = 3

	SharpLength = 125 // Determines How far you can aim.

	Magazine = Magazine
		CopyOf = Magazine Pistol // Defines which magazine instance to use.

		ParentOffset = Vector
			X = -2
			Y = 1

	Flash = Attachable
		CopyOf = Muzzle Flash Pistol // Defines which muzzle flash instance to use.
Sounds

	FireSound = Sound
		AddSample = ContentFile
			FilePath = Base.rte/Devices/Pistols/PistolBang.wav // Tells The HDFirearm what sound to use when shooting.

	EmptySound = Sound
		AddSample = ContentFile
			FilePath = Base.rte/Devices/EmptyClick3.wav // ...when pulling the trigger but out of rounds.

	ReloadStartSound = Sound
		AddSample = ContentFile
			FilePath = Base.rte/Devices/ReloadStart.wav // ...when removing used magazine.

	ReloadEndSound = Sound
		AddSample = ContentFile
			FilePath = Base.rte/Devices/ReloadEnd.wav // ...when installing new magazine.
	RateOfFire = 200 // Measured in rounds per minute (RPM or round/min).

	ReloadTime = 1500 // Amount of time it takes to reload in milliseconds.
 
	FullAuto = 0 // Boolean value that determines if it is fully automatic (1) or not (0).

	FireIgnoresThis = 1 // If the shot effects the HDF or the HDF's firer.

	ShakeRange = 13 // Range of shake (inaccuracy) due to movement.

	SharpShakeRange = 3 // Range of shake (inaccuracy) whilst aiming down the sights/barrel of HDF.

	NoSupportFactor = 1.5 // Multiplier that effects ShakeRanges if the HDF is not supported with the other hand.

	ParticleSpreadRange = 3 // Range (degrees) of bullet spread.

	ShellSpreadRange = 8 // Range (degrees) of shell spread.

	ShellAngVelRange = 2 // Range of angular velocity (how fast they rotate) on the shells.

	MuzzleOffset = Vector
		X = 5
		Y = -1
	EjectionOffset = Vector
		X = -3
		Y = -1
	AddGib = Gib
		GibParticle = MOPixel
			CopyOf = Spark Yellow 1
		Count = 3
		Spread = 2.25
		MaxVelocity = 20
		MinVelocity = 8

	GibWoundLimit = 2 // Amount of wounds required for the HDF to gib.
